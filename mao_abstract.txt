
We present numerical solutions to the coupled Nernst-Planck-Poisson-Stokes equation for the electroosmotic flow through a circular nanopore. The pore traverses a dielectric membrane with surface charges. A multi-physics solver that incorporates electrostatics, ionic transport and electroosmotic flow is developed using the OpenFOAM CFD library. In the limit of small surface charge and weak applied electric field, the numerical results of fluid flux agree with theory when the thickness of the pore $h$ is either or infinite. For intermediate $h/a$, our simulation also matches the composite model of electroosmotic conductance. When the finite permittivity of the dieletric membrane is to be considered, the solver is modified to include the solid region in addition to the fluid region. In this case our simulations show the existence of eddies at the corners of the nanopore. If the geometry is chosen correctly, the stagnation points merge to
form a single stagnation point at which four streamlines cross.
